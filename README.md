## Rule induction system for binary classification

This project demonstrates a rule induction system classifying binary data in the form of binary and floating point values. Using a genetic algorithm it evolves a set of rules to discover the underlying data structure

#### How to build locally
`mkdir build && cd build`
`cmake ..`
`make all`
`./GeneticAlgorithm`
